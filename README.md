# Connect Four Portfolio Project
### Written by Eden Albert

Portfolio Project for CS201 at The University of Alabama Spring 2019.
For my portfolio project I decided to try and code the Connect Four game in C!
This project can be accessed by going to https://github.com/edenalbert/portfolio


### Getting Started
The code for this project is included in one .c file, so it is fairly easy to run. Simple run the
makefile
