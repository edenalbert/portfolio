# Connect Four Portfolio Project
### Written by Eden Albert

Portfolio Project for CS201 at The University of Alabama Spring 2019.
For my portfolio project I decided to try and code the Connect Four game in C!
This project can be accessed by going to https://github.com/edenalbert/portfolio
A video demonstration can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsxY_0T64Z0&feature=youtu.be).

### Getting Started
The code for this project is included in one .c file, so it is fairly easy to run. Simple run the makefile via the 'make' command in the terminal. Then enter './connectFourMain' and the project will run.
